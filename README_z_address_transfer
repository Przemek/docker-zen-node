#Transfer funds from the node t-address to two z-addresses
#to charge the node's balance for challenges using the following commands.

#Enter bash of the zen-node container:
#docker exec -it zen-node bash

#Issue the initial transfer after first install:
#gosu user zen-cli z_sendmany $(gosu user zen-cli listaddresses | jq -r '.[1]') '[{"address": "'$(gosu user zen-cli z_getnewaddress)'", "amount": 0.0249},{"address": "'$(gosu user zen-cli z_getnewaddress)'", "amount": 0.0249}]'

#Issue a refill transfer after challenge balance is depleted:
#gosu user zen-cli z_sendmany $(gosu user zen-cli listaddresses | jq -r '.[1]') '[{"address": "'$(gosu user zen-cli z_listaddresses | jq -r '.[0]')'", "amount": 0.0249},{"address": "'$(gosu user zen-cli z_listaddresses | jq -r '.[1]')'", "amount": 0.0249}]'

#To exit the bash of the container without closing it, press:
#Ctrl+P
